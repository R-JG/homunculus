# %homunculus

%homunculus is an agent that turns Sail elements into a terminal interface. For the user, %homunculus is like a cross between a browser, text editor, and multiplexer for Urbit apps in the terminal. For the developer, %homunculus allows you to use XML/Sail to create TUIs as if you were building a Web UI.

%homunculus is under developement. Join the group ~nidlep-sivrec/homunculus to learn more.
